# AI-Enhanced Medical Research Project

## Purpose

This project aims to explore the effectiveness of leveraging AI-classified data as input for traditional medical research methodologies. By integrating state-of-the-art named entity recognition (NER) models, the project seeks to enhance the extraction of meaningful information from medical notes. The goal is to evaluate the predictive power of this AI-classified data in forecasting medical outcomes, thereby contributing to the evolving intersection of artificial intelligence and medical research.

## Overview

The project utilizes a biomedical NER model, specifically "d4data/biomedical-ner-all," to analyze medical notes and extract relevant entities. These entities, along with additional metadata from the input data, are then processed and structured into a format conducive to traditional medical research. The output is a JSON file containing detailed information about recognized entities and their potential correlations with medical outcomes.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
